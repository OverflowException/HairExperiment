1. Try construct hair strands from a valid initial position, not flat on the ground,
   and consruct constraint frames in reference to individualt hair bone's initial states

2. Is collision between hair strands necessary?
   If not, set collision mask and ground to prevent inter-strands collisions

3. Why do strands jiggle so much, an how to sync strands movement as much as possible?

4. Base bone of each strands may not be necessary. Attach stands tangent to scalp.
